GCash QR Code Instructions
===========================

To complete the payment integration, please add your GCash QR code image to this folder.

1. Save your GCash QR code image as "gcash_qr.png" or "gcash_qr.jpg"
2. Place it in this folder: /assets/img/payment/
3. The image should be clear and scannable
4. Recommended size: 300x300 pixels or larger

Once you add the QR code image, customers will be able to scan it to make payments and upload proof of payment.

For now, the system will show a placeholder message until you add the actual QR code image.
